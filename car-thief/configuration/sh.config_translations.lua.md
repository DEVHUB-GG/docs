# sh.config\_translations.lua

Every player-facing string lives in this file under `Config.Lang`. Translate the values into your language — keep the keys and any `{placeholder}` tokens (e.g. `{name}`, `{position}`, `{time}`) unchanged, as the script fills them in at runtime.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">**Ui** — terminal &amp; device interface</mark>

Labels shown inside the Car Checker terminal and the Key Cloner device.

```lua

```

* **Description**: Interface text for the in-game devices. `terminal_init` is a fake shell prompt prefix; the player's typed plate is appended to it.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">**Script** — notifications &amp; targets</mark>

Notifications, target prompts and NPC dialog lines shown during the job. Several values contain `{placeholder}` tokens that are replaced at runtime.

```lua
    Script = {

```

* **Description**: All notifications, target labels and dialog text used across the job.
* **Placeholders**: Keep tokens such as `{name}` (target owner / NPC name), `{position}` (queue position), `{cooldown}` / `{time}` (seconds), `{label}` and `{amount}` (requirement item) intact — they are filled in by the script.
